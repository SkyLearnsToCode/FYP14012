Implementing SIMBICON should require modifying toycontrol.{h,cpp}, which 
contains the control algorithm for the model defined in toybody.{h,cpp}.  

The sample code defines a PD servo at every joint of toybody, where _ks[i] 
and _kd[i] are the spring and damping constants, _target[i] are the target 
angles.
